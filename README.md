This is a project written in Python Django Framework.
I scraped data from href=https://bama.ir/ and inserted the data into the database (by scrape.py module).
Then the scraped data was cleaned as the dataset of the Ml-Poroject.
The dataset is analyzed by the RandomForestRegressor algorithm.
If you give the specifications of your car, it will predict the approximate price of your car.
To update the dataset run the scrape.py module.
