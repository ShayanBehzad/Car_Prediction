# Car Price Prediction with Django and Machine Learning
Welcome to our project, a cutting-edge application designed to predict the price of cars based on their specifications. Leveraging the power of Python's Django framework and machine learning algorithms, we've created a user-friendly website that not only provides a prediction service but also showcases the underlying technology.

# Features
- Data Scraping and Cleaning: Automatically scrapes data from https://bama.ir/ and processes it into a clean, machine-readable dataset (this is done by scrape.py module).
- Machine Learning Model: Utilizes the RandomForestRegressor algorithm to analyze the dataset and predict car prices with high accuracy.
- Web Interface: A user-friendly website built with Django, allowing users to input car specifications and receive a price prediction instantly.
