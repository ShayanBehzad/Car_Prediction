This is a project developed by Shayan Behzad written in python Django framework.
I scraped data from href=https://bama.ir/ and inserted the data into the database.
Then the scraped data was cleaned as the dataset of the Ml-Poroject.
The dataset is analyzed by the RandomForestRegressor algorithm.
If you give the specifications of your car, it will predict the approximate price of your car.
